1. Self-Awareness: The Foundation of Strong Leadership
Great leaders understand their own strengths, weaknesses, and emotional triggers. Self-awareness allows them to make decisions with confidence, regulate their emotions under pressure, and adapt their leadership style to different situations.

2. Self-Regulation: Managing Emotions Effectively
Emotional intelligence is not about suppressing emotions but channeling them productively. Leaders who practice self-regulation remain composed during crises, respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively, and set a positive example for their teams.
